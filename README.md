# macOS Background Manager
Allows you to manage default backgrounds in macOS

## Dependencies

To get this script working, you need:

* Python 3 (I use Python 3.6.8), download it at https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/
* Admin rights

## Add default backgrounds

To add backgrounds, use the ``adddefaultbackground.py`` script.

Here is how to use it:

```
sudo python3 adddefaultbackground.py backgroundfile.heic
```

macOS supports heic, png and jpg for default backgrounds.

## Remove default backgrounds

The script isn't ready yet! This part will be updated once the script will be ready!

# Warning

This script was tested in macOS Catalina with SIP disabled! If you have any problem with it, create an issue.
